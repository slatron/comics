    description: `<p>Steve gets to show his strengths as a strategist with moral
      conviction in every aspect of this story. Hickman shows how this is Cap's best asset
      and achilles heel. His man-out-of-time condition is
      taken in a completlely new cosmic direction. Hickman excels at taking what
      a character represents to move plot and theme. Cap is the best example in this run.</p>
      
      <p>In Hickman's Avengers, Steve is a tragic hero. He is destined
      to fail against both cosmic and team threats. Hickman still makes Steve
      an inspirational and aspirational character until the final issues of
      "Time Runs Out". In the end even Cap is brought down to trading blows
      with Tony as the universes collapse.</p>
      
      <p>During the initial phases of the Illuminati's plans, Steve is the only one
      holding the line at not destroying the incursion planets. Even while in control
      of all six gems, the rest of the Illuminati is skeptical of Steve's plan to
      use them to prevent the incursion with no casulaties.</p>

      <p>After Steve's plan backfires and the gems are destroyed, he has to deal with
      the consequences foir the remainder of the series. The remainder of the Illuminati
      erase his memories of them and move forward with Tony's plan to destroy worlds.</p>

      <p>Steve continues his plans to make the Avengers a bigger team with Tony,
      not realizing that plan is partially a ruse by Tony to distract him from
      the Illuminati's ongoing efforts to destroy worlds at incursion points.
      
      <p>Steve plays a key leadership role during the cosmic war. He is council with the
      componay of Ronan, K'lurt, Brood Queen, Guardian. Annhilius and Json of Sparta 
      during the war agains the beyonders(?). Hickman shows that Steve's true power is
      as a strategist. Each of these leaders lets Steve's plan take place. And it alwyas
      works as Cap intends - even if only for a moment before the threat gets bigger.</p>

      <p>Before the story can become Tony vs Steve, Hickman steers Cap into a completely
      new take on his "man out of time" status. Reverberations from when Steve destroyed
      the time gem send him and some Avengers forward in time.  Cap relaizes that Tony
      is wrong - that the incursions are not the end of everything. He's just not certain
      if its because of what the Illuminati plan to do or not.</p>

      <p>It's here that Hickman takes the biggest swing with Steve. His moral code tells him
      that even if what the Illuminati are doing saves all remaining life in the multiverses, it
      is not worth it if it means destroying a single world. Steve doesn't even consider
      sacrificing the few to save the many. Hickman draws a strong line in the sand that 
      Steve will never cross.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for Cap and Tony, fate doesn't work out the way either of them
      intended. It feels unfinished as the world finally collapses around Steve as he and
      Tony trade impotent punches. But that's the point. Tony and Steve are almost completely
      sidelined for the final Secret act of this story after being the focus for so long. The point
      is that it never mattered in the grand scheme. Steve wasn't punching Tony as much as he
      was punching Hickman - for tricking him into believing he was the hero up until he
      faded away.</p>
