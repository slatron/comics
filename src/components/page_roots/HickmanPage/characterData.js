    description: `Steve gets to show his strengths as a strategist with a moral
      center in every aspect of this story. Hickman puts Steve in the toughest
      position of his life at a cosmic level. In my reading of Hickman's Avengers,
      Steve is a tragic hero. He is destined to fail against both cosmic and team
      disintegration. Hickman still makes Steve an inspirational and aspirational
      character. At least until the final issues of "Time Runs Out" where even he is
      brought down to trading blows with Tony as the universes collapse.
      
      During the initial phases of the Illuminati's plans, Steve is the only one
      holding the line at not destroying the incursion planets. Even while in control
      of all six gems, the rest of the Illuminati is skeptical of Steve's plan to
      use them to prevent the incursion with no casulaties.

      After Steve's plan backfires and the gems are destroyed, he has to deal with
      the consequences foir the remainder of the series. The remainder of the Illuminati
      erase his memories of them and move forward with Tony's plan to destroy worlds.

      Steve goes on to continue his plans to make the Avengers a bigger team with Tony,
      not realizing that plan in itself is partially a ruse by Tony to distract him from
      the Illuminati's ongoing efforts to destroy worlds at incursion points.
